# Fake News Detection with NLTK and Machine Learning

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to detect fake news using Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) for text preprocessing and scikit-learn for classification.

## Overview

The project involves several steps, including:
- Installing NLTK and its dependencies.
- Downloading necessary NLTK corpora.
- Loading and preprocessing a dataset containing both fake and genuine news articles.
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).
- Building and training machine learning models.
- Evaluating model performance.

## Installation

1. Install NLTK and its dependencies.
2. Download necessary NLTK corpora.
3. Install scikit-learn.

## Usage

1. Load and preprocess the dataset.
2. Feature extraction using TF-IDF.
3. Train machine learning models.
4. Evaluate model performance.

## Results

The project aims to achieve accurate classification of fake and genuine news articles.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests for improvements.
