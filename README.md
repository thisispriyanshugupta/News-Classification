# MNIST Digit Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks

## Overview

This project aims to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) implemented in TensorFlow and Keras. The MNIST dataset comprises 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits (0-9), each of size 28x28 pixels. The primary objective is to develop a CNN model capable of accurately identifying these digits.

## Project Structure

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Load the MNIST dataset, reshape images, and normalize pixel values.
   
2. **Data Visualization**: Utilize Matplotlib to display sample images from the training set.
   
3. **Model Building**: Construct a Sequential model with convolutional, pooling, dropout, and dense layers.
   
4. **Model Compilation**: Compile the model with appropriate optimizer, loss function, and evaluation metric.
   
5. **Model Training**: Train the model on the training data.
   
6. **Model Evaluation**: Assess the model's performance on the test set.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/thisispriyanshugupta/News-Classification.git
   cd News-Classification

   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Load and Preprocess Data

```python
import tensorflow as tf

(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()

x_train = x_train.reshape(x_train.shape[0], 28, 28, 1)
x_test = x_test.reshape(x_test.shape[0], 28, 28, 1)
x_train = x_train.astype("float32") / 255
x_test = x_test.astype("float32") / 255
```

### Visualize Sample Images

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline

fig, axs = plt.subplots(4, 4, figsize=(20, 20))
plt.gray()
for i, ax in enumerate(axs.flat):
    ax.matshow(x_train[i])
    ax.axis("off")
    ax.set_title('Number {}'.format(y_train[i]))
plt.show()
```

### Build the Model

```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Conv2D, Dropout, Flatten, MaxPooling2D

input_shape = (28, 28, 1)

model = Sequential([
    Conv2D(28, kernel_size=(3,3), input_shape=input_shape, activation='relu'),
    MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    Dropout(0.2),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
```

### Compile the Model

```python
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])
```

### Train the Model

```python
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=1)
```

### Evaluate the Model

```python
model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)
```

## Results

The initial model achieved an accuracy of approximately 11.35% on the test set. Further improvements can be made by tuning hyperparameters, increasing the number of epochs, or experimenting with different network architectures.
